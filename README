DrippsOperation
===============

A quick and easy way to manage CoreData on background threads in
iOS 4.0 and higher.


Requirements
------------

- iOS 4.0 - NSOperation (which this extends) was introduced in iOS 4.0
- Core Data Framework


How to Use
----------

Subclass DrippsOperation and add a "- (void)main" function to your
implementation.  The operation's NSManagedObjectContext is stored in
an instance variable named "nsmoc".  This should be the only context
used throughout all the code being executed in the operation.  When
you're finished just call [self saveChanges]; to save the context and
you're done.

You can add DrippsOperation subclasses to any NSOperationQueue, but I
have also provided DrippsQueueManager to help manage multiple queues.
I often find myself with the need for synchronous and asynchronous
queues in the same project.  While I could take the time to set up
dependencies to achieve the same thing, many times my operations are
completely unrelated and it's much quicker to create a queue with a
max concurrency of 1 for the synchronous queues and completely separate
queues for asynchronous operation queues.

Please feel free to fork this project or suggest enhancements by
